Allows users to set a mood for themselves to display on their postbit(s) and in their profile.

Moods can be added or deleted via the Admin CP by going to the Configuration > Moods section.

This plugin offers full language support. Mood icons can also be translated. To translate, create a folder in the images/mood folder with the same name as the language (English included by default) then Upload the translated icons to that folder (make sure they have the same file name as the English version). If a translated icon doesn't exist for a mood, it will default back to the English icon.

The 'oldrelease' branch contains the 1.6 version of the plugin.
